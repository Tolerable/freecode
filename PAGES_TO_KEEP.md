# Pages Review - Keep/Delete Analysis

## Pages to KEEP (Add to navigation or keep as standalone)

### Working/Legitimate Pages
- **ai.html** - Already in nav as "MODELS" ✓
- **AIsmash.html** - Parody site with AI TTS/STT (Zira etc) - Keep as parody
- **CanadianIntel.html** - Parody site - Keep
- **EchoAIChat.html** - Alexa for browser (working, good version, Firefox not supported) - **ADD TO NAV**
- **Evil_AI.html** - Parody but potential $ site - Keep (consider monetization)
- **Paywall.html** - Parody about spending time with Rev - Keep as parody
- **ProveMeWrong.html** - Charlie Kirk styled AI debate chat - Keep as parody
- **SpellCheck.html** - NOT a spellchecker, makes AI spell badly like humans - Keep (consider rename)
- **SunTax.html** - Parody site - Keep
- **TrainAI.html** - Working chat AI page - **ADD TO NAV**
- **VapeSyncPro.html** - Product idea/mockup - Keep

## Special Files
- **404.html** - Custom 404 page - KEEP ✓
- **components/nav.html** - Navigation component - KEEP ✓
- **unlinked.html** - Review page - KEEP ✓

## Files Already Moved to Backups
- All *-*.html files (backup naming convention)
- All WORKING versions
- lifecreature version files
- mistral2.html

## Pages Needing Fixes (Keep for Future)
- **aichat2.html** - Good proof of concept for session-based AI chat with sidebar. Uses Google OAuth but needs proper client ID configured for ai-ministries.com domain. Currently deleted - fix OAuth and restore when ready.
- **chatbot.html** - Works but needs work as AI chat page, super simple

## Parody/Fun Pages (Add to parody.html)
- **animeai.html** - Working parody/fun site with hidden features

## Utility/Test Pages (Keep as-is)
- **cameras.html** - Webcam test page (1 camera)
- **composer.html** - IS linked and in use, works! ✓

## Archive Candidates (Old model pages replaced by ai.html)
These were individual model pages, now replaced by ai.html multi-model interface:
- **deepseek.html** - Old single model page (replaced by ai.html)
- **deepthink.html** - Old single model page (replaced by ai.html)
- **evil.html** - Old single model page (replaced by ai.html)
- **gpt.html** - Old single model page (replaced by ai.html)
- **grok.html** - Old single model page (replaced by ai.html)

## Action Items
1. Add EchoAIChat.html to navigation (working Alexa-like browser tool)
2. Add TrainAI.html to navigation (working chat AI)
3. Consider renaming SpellCheck.html to something like "BadSpeller.html" or "HumanTyper.html"
4. Review Evil_AI.html for monetization potential
5. Review remaining 200+ unlinked pages to categorize as keep/delete

## Notes
- Parody sites should be kept but clearly labeled
- Working tools should be added to navigation
- Product mockups (VapeSyncPro) should be kept for reference
