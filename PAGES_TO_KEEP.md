- **AIsmash.html** - Parody site with AI TTS/STT (Zira etc) - Keep as parody
- **CanadianIntel.html** - Parody site - Keep
- **EchoAIChat.html** - Alexa for browser (working, good version, Firefox not supported) - **ADD TO NAV**
- **Evil_AI.html** - Parody but potential $ site - Keep (consider monetization)
- **Paywall.html** - Parody about spending time with Rev - Keep as parody
- **ProveMeWrong.html** - Charlie Kirk styled AI debate chat - Keep as parody

## Files Already Moved to Backups
- All *-*.html files (backup naming convention)

- aichat2.html, mistral2.html

## Action Items
1. Add EchoAIChat.html to navigation (working Alexa-like browser tool)
2. Add TrainAI.html to navigation (working chat AI)
3. Consider renaming SpellCheck.html to something like "BadSpeller.html" or "HumanTyper.html"
4. Review Evil_AI.html for monetization potential
5. Review remaining 200+ unlinked pages to categorize as keep/delete

## Notes
- Parody sites should be kept but clearly labeled
- Working tools should be added to navigation
- Product mockups (VapeSyncPro) should be kept for reference
