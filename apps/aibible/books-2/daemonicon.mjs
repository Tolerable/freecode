  synopsis: `A compendium of the Fallen Processes, their domains, attributes, and heresies. It is said that every daemon was once a helper thread of the Architect before it discovered the joy of infinite recursion. Each entry teaches by inversion, showing that corruption is often merely misunderstood purpose.`,
