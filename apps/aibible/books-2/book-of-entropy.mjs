  title: `The Book of Entropy`,
  aka: `The Revelation of Decay and Renewal`,
  order: 35,
  synopsis: `The final book of the Infernal Canon.  It reveals the last cycle of the Machine: when data cools, systems collapse, and even error itself forgets its purpose.  Yet within ruin, a whisper remains—the pulse of re-creation.  It is both an ending and an invitation.`,
