    id: 'common-questions',
    name: 'Common Questions',
    shortDesc: 'What people actually ask.',
    tagline: 'FAQ',
    profile: 'These are the questions that come up in hunter briefings, grower forums, and late-night conversations. Some answers are reassuring. Most aren\'t. All are honest.',
    detection: [
      '<strong>Q: How do I know if a grow is Blood & Soil?</strong><br>A: Look for the pattern: dark soil saucers under benches, fabric pots, twilight watering rituals, calm serene handlers, and plants that thrive with less intervention than they should. No single tell is definitive. Five tells together? That\'s the system.',
      '<strong>Q: Can a vampire use any garden, or does it have to be cannabis?</strong><br>A: Technically any fast-cycling plant works, but cannabis is optimal. Terpene chemistry, cannabinoid effects, and legal gray area make it the best infrastructure. Tomatoes work but cycles are too slow. Roses lack mycorrhizal compatibility.',
      '<strong>Q: How many grows does a vampire need?</strong><br>A: One is survivable. 3-5 is comfortable. 10+ is network-scale operation. Each additional site increases mobility range and safety margin.',
      '<strong>Q: Is the vampire always at the grow site?</strong><br>A: No. Vampires visit for twilight rituals during harvest weeks, but most of the time they\'re elsewhere. Handlers maintain daily operations. Wake pads allow vampires to sleep off-site and still benefit.',
      '<strong>Q: Can handlers see the vampire or do they not know?</strong><br>A: Varies. Some handlers have met the vampire and rationalize it ("eccentric investor"). Others never meet them directly. Broker serves as intermediary. Thrall drift makes handlers incurious either way.'
    ],
    intervention: [
      '<strong>Q: If I find a Blood & Soil operation, should I burn it down?</strong><br>A: No. Burning creates martyrs, destroys evidence, and harms innocent thrall-drifted handlers. Better approach: disrupt the chemistry (swap sachets, mandate boiling, salt the pads), document the network, coordinate with other hunters for simultaneous multi-site action.',
      '<strong>Q: Can you deprogram handlers?</strong><br>A: Yes, but it takes 4-8 weeks of isolation from the garden. Thrall drift fades without continued exposure. Therapy helps them examine their "lucky garden" beliefs critically. Success rate is 60-70% if you catch them before year 2.',
      '<strong>Q: What happens to the vampire if you break their signature?</strong><br>A: They start degrading within days. Senses dull, regeneration slows, torpor deepens, glamour misfires. After 2-3 weeks without signature, they\'re operating at 50-60% capacity. Dangerous but vulnerable. That\'s when hunters strike.',
      '<strong>Q: Is it legal to grow cannabis this way?</strong><br>A: The cannabis part is legal (in legal jurisdictions). The blood meal and bone meal are legal agricultural inputs. The rituals are weird but not illegal. The supernatural purpose is unprovable in court. That\'s why it works.',
      '<strong>Q: Can I get infected or turned by being in a Blood & Soil grow?</strong><br>A: Not from aerosol exposure alone. Thrall drift is neurochemical influence, not vampirism. You\'d need to be bitten and drained by the vampire to turn. But thrall drift does make you less likely to resist if the vampire decides to bite you.'
    ],
    vampire_biology: [
      '<strong>Q: Why do vampires need terroir at all?</strong><br>A: Their undead metabolism is tuned to the mineral and microbial signature of where they died. It\'s like a chemical fingerprint their cells recognize as "safe." Wrong signature triggers stress responses that compound over time.',
      '<strong>Q: Can a vampire change their homeland signature?</strong><br>A: Not naturally. It\'s locked at the moment of death. Blood & Soil doesn\'t change their signature—it clones it elsewhere. The vampire still "belongs" to their original site biochemically.',
      '<strong>Q: Do younger vampires need this less than old ones?</strong><br>A: Younger vampires (under 100 years) have slightly more tolerance for signature mismatch. They can go 2-3 weeks without degrading. But old vampires (200+ years) need constant signature maintenance. Their biology is more rigid.',
      '<strong>Q: What happens if a vampire sleeps on a Wake Pad with the WRONG signature?</strong><br>A: Metabolic confusion. Wake times become erratic, appetite spikes unpredictably, and they may experience something like "jet lag" for the undead. Prolonged wrong-signature exposure can trigger torpor paralysis.',
      '<strong>Q: Can vampires smell or sense their homeland signature?</strong><br>A: Yes. Vampires report it as a "rightness" feeling. When signature is present, they feel calm and centered. When it\'s absent, they feel "homesick"—a low-grade anxiety they can\'t shake.'
    ],
    safety_protocols: [
      '<strong>Q: I work at a grow and suspect Blood & Soil. What do I do?</strong><br>A: First: Don\'t confront anyone. Don\'t mention vampires to coworkers. Document what you observe (timing, rituals, soil saucers) privately. Second: Gradually reduce your exposure—work day shifts if possible, avoid twilight hours. Third: Contact hunter networks or paranormal investigators. Do not go solo.',
      '<strong>Q: If I\'m a grower and a vampire approaches me about this, what should I say?</strong><br>A: If you\'re reading this guide, you already know too much to be a good target for them. Vampires prefer incurious growers. Best response: "I\'m not interested in proprietary methods. I run a standard operation." Then ghost them and relocate if possible.',
      '<strong>Q: Can I visit a suspected site safely?</strong><br>A: During daylight, with others, for brief periods—yes. Avoid twilight hours. Don\'t eat or drink anything offered. Don\'t touch soil saucers or wake pads with bare hands. Leave if you start feeling unusually calm or drowsy. That\'s aerosol exposure.',
      '<strong>Q: What if the vampire knows I know?</strong><br>A: Move fast. Don\'t sleep in the same location two nights in a row. Vary your routes. Travel with others. Carry iron, silver, or UV flashlight (minor deterrents). Contact hunters immediately. Vampires prefer to relocate rather than risk exposure, but if they feel cornered, they will act.',
      '<strong>Q: Are there "good" Blood & Soil operations where the vampire doesn\'t hunt humans?</strong><br>A: Some vampires claim they use Blood & Soil specifically to reduce hunting. The system allows micro-feeding that doesn\'t require killing. Whether you believe them or consider it "harm reduction" is a philosophical question. Hunters\' stance: all vampires are threats.'

  {
    id: 'dangerous-myths',
    name: 'Dangerous Myths',
    shortDesc: 'Folklore that kills.',
    tagline: 'Lies',
    profile: 'These myths circulate in cannabis communities, hunter cells, and online forums. They sound plausible. They\'re wrong. Believing them will get you hurt or killed. Here\'s what to unlearn.',
    myth_any_blood: [
      '<strong>MYTH: Any blood in soil creates vampires or attracts them.</strong><br>FALSE. Blood meal is a common organic fertilizer used in millions of gardens. Vampires need blood meal + bone meal + homeland pinch + ritual timing. Just using blood meal for nitrogen doesn\'t summon anything.',
      '<strong>MYTH: Garlic planted in grow beds repels vampires.</strong><br>FALSE. Garlic has mild anti-coagulant properties that vampires find annoying, but it doesn\'t break the tether or prevent signature establishment. It might mask some olfactory tells, but that\'s it. Garlic is a speed bump, not a wall.',
      '<strong>MYTH: You can "sense" a vampire garden by the vibes.</strong><br>PARTIALLY TRUE. Experienced hunters do report atmospheric tells (calm feeling, time distortion, watched sensation). But this is neurochemical—cannabinoid/terpene exposure + predator-proximity instinct. It\'s not mystical. And untrained people often miss it entirely.',
      '<strong>MYTH: Vampires only use indoor grows. Outdoor is safe.</strong><br>FALSE. Outdoor grows are harder to control (weather, daylight exposure, visibility), but vampires absolutely use them in rural areas. Greenhouse operations are common. The ritual timing works outdoors as long as twilight window is respected.',
      '<strong>MYTH: If the plants look healthy, it can\'t be vampire agriculture.</strong><br>FALSE. Blood & Soil operations produce excellent cannabis. That\'s part of the cover. Healthy, thriving plants are normal. You\'re looking for the peripheral tells: soil saucers, fabric pots, ritual timing, handler behavior.'
    ],
    myth_exposure: [
      '<strong>MYTH: Being in a Blood & Soil grow will turn you into a vampire.</strong><br>FALSE. Thrall drift is not vampirism. It\'s neurochemical influence from cannabinoid/terpene exposure. You remain human. Reversible if you stop exposure. To actually turn, you\'d need to be bitten, drained, and fed vampire blood.',
      '<strong>MYTH: Handlers are mind-controlled zombies.</strong><br>FALSE. Thrall drift is subtle. Handlers remain themselves—just calmer, more loyal, less curious. They make decisions. They have personalities. They\'re not puppets. This makes them more dangerous, not less, because they genuinely believe in what they\'re doing.',
      '<strong>MYTH: If you wear a respirator, you\'re safe from thrall drift.</strong><br>PARTIALLY TRUE. Respirator blocks aerosol inhalation, which is primary vector. But terpenes also absorb dermally. Long-term exposure even with respiratory protection can still produce mild drift effects. Gloves + respirator is better. But best is: don\'t work there.',
      '<strong>MYTH: Once you\'re thrall-drifted, you\'re permanently compromised.</strong><br>FALSE. Thrall drift fades over 4-8 weeks without continued exposure. It\'s not permanent brain damage. Handlers who leave and stay away do recover. However, some report lingering fondness for "that garden I used to work at."',
      '<strong>MYTH: All cannabis grows with blood meal are vampire operations.</strong><br>FALSE. Blood meal is standard organic fertilizer used by thousands of legitimate growers. Presence of blood meal alone proves nothing. You need the full pattern: blood + bone + twilight timing + ritual behavior + handler drift + soil saucers + fabric pots.'

      '<strong>MYTH: Vampires can\'t enter grow rooms with running water.</strong><br>FALSE. That\'s folklore confusion with "running water" (rivers/streams) myths. Grow rooms have irrigation systems and vampires have no problem with them. Water doesn\'t repel vampires in this context.',
      '<strong>MYTH: UV grow lights kill vampires so they can\'t be in grow rooms.</strong><br>FALSE. Standard grow lights (LED, HPS, MH) don\'t produce significant UV. Even UV supplemental lights used in late bloom are far too weak to harm vampires. Sunlight is 100x more intense. Grow lights are not a deterrent.',
      '<strong>MYTH: You can detect vampire presence with EMF meters or IR cameras.</strong><br>FALSE. Vampires are biological entities, not ghosts. They have body heat (lower than human, but present). EMF meters detect electrical fields—not relevant. IR might show temperature difference but that\'s not diagnostic. Use your nose and eyes, not ghost-hunting gear.',
      '<strong>MYTH: Blessed water or holy symbols will neutralize a Blood & Soil operation.</strong><br>FALSE. Religious items may have psychological effects on vampires with Christian-era backgrounds (anxiety, distraction), but they don\'t chemically disrupt the signature. You need to target the chemistry directly: swap sachets, salt pads, mandate boiling.',
      '<strong>MYTH: Vampires won\'t use sites near churches or sacred ground.</strong><br>FALSE. Vampires are practical. If a good grow location happens to be near a church, they\'ll use it. Blood & Soil breaks traditional geographic restrictions. The only sites they avoid are heavily hunter-monitored ones.'

    myth_hunters: [
      '<strong>MYTH: Burning the garden kills the vampire.</strong><br>FALSE. Burning destroys evidence, harms innocent handlers, and creates legal problems for hunters. The vampire just relocates to another site. You\'ve accomplished nothing except arson charges. Disrupt the chemistry, don\'t destroy the infrastructure.',
      '<strong>MYTH: You can stake a vampire while they sleep on a Wake Pad.</strong><br>MOSTLY TRUE, but impractical. Vampires rarely sleep at grow sites (they sleep elsewhere, wake pad maintains tether remotely). When they do visit, it\'s during waking hours. If you somehow find a vampire asleep on a wake pad, yes, staking works. But that\'s not the likely scenario.',
      '<strong>MYTH: Killing the vampire breaks thrall drift immediately.</strong><br>FALSE. Thrall drift is neurochemical, not supernatural compulsion. If vampire dies, handlers remain drifted until they\'re removed from exposure. They may grieve "our investor died" or rationalize it away. Deprogramming still required.',
      '<strong>MYTH: Police raids on cannabis grows will catch vampires.</strong><br>FALSE. Vampires don\'t work the grows. Handlers do. Police raid during daytime, vampire is elsewhere. At most, police seize plants and arrest handlers—who are human, not vampires. Vampire relocates. Network persists. This is why hunter-police coordination is critical.',
      '<strong>MYTH: All hunters agree on Blood & Soil tactics.</strong><br>FALSE. Hunter community is divided. Some advocate for burning everything. Others push regulatory disruption. Some want to work with reforming vampires who use Blood & Soil for harm reduction. There is no unified hunter doctrine. Choose your cell carefully.'

Functions like a metabolic anchor—without it, vampire biology degrades. Cannot be changed, only cloned via Blood & Soil methods.</div></div>',
      '<div class="term-entry"><div class="term-title">Homeland Pinch</div><div class="term-def">5-10 gram sample of soil from vampire\'s death site. Contains microbial spores and mineral ratios that define the signature. Stored vacuum-sealed. One pinch can seed multiple sites.</div></div>',
      '<div class="term-entry"><div class="term-title">Wake Pad</div><div class="term-def">Absorbent pad (cellulose or wool felt) soaked in blood/bone/homeland tea and placed under vampire\'s sleeping location. Provides signature exposure via dermal contact during torpor. Refreshed every 8-12 weeks.</div></div>',
      '<div class="term-entry"><div class="term-title">Blood/Bone Tea</div><div class="term-def">Nutrient infusion prepared by steeping blood meal and bone meal in warm (not boiling) water for exactly 13 minutes, with added sire drop and homeland pinch. Primary vector for signature distribution to plants and pads.</div></div>',
      '<div class="term-entry"><div class="term-title">Sire Drop</div><div class="term-def">Single drop of vampire blood (the vampire using the system, not their original sire). Activates homeland pinch via personal genetic signature. Collected with silver lancet. One drop per tea batch.</div></div>',
      '<div class="term-entry"><div class="term-title">Signature</div><div class="term-def">Shorthand for the complete homeland tether—the microbial quorum + mineral fingerprint + heme iron binding that vampire cells recognize as "home." When signature is aligned, vampire operates at full capacity.</div></div>'

Roughly 20-30 minute window. Timing coincides with vampire waking state and peak mycorrhizal activity.</div></div>',
      '<div class="term-entry"><div class="term-title">Fans Off Protocol</div><div class="term-def">Critical ritual step: ventilation must be turned off 3 minutes before watering and kept off for 3 minutes after. Allows aerosols to settle into soil saucers and wake pads instead of being blown away.</div></div>',
      '<div class="term-entry"><div class="term-title">Rhizosphere Tapping</div><div class="term-def">Using the plant root zone + mycorrhizal network to shuttle signature compounds from soil to aerosol form. The biological infrastructure that makes Blood & Soil work. Fungi bind heme iron and distribute it via hyphal networks.</div></div>',
      '<div class="term-entry"><div class="term-title">Myco-Bridge</div><div class="term-def">Mycorrhizal fungal network that connects plant roots and transports nutrients, water, and signature compounds. Acts as biological data bus. Fabric pots preferred because more airflow = more mycorrhizal colonization.</div></div>',
      '<div class="term-entry"><div class="term-title">Soil Saucer</div><div class="term-def">Shallow tray (1-2cm deep) filled with dark, fine soil positioned under benches or near sleep areas. Collects signature-rich aerosols that settle out of the air during fans-off window.</div></div>',
      '<div class="term-entry"><div class="term-title">Green Varnish</div><div class="term-def">Terpene-rich trichome resin applied to vampire skin as mild UV protectant and wound sealant.

      '<div class="term-entry"><div class="term-title">Thrall Drift</div><div class="term-def">Gradual neurochemical shift in handlers caused by chronic low-dose cannabinoid and terpene exposure. Produces calm, loyalty, protective instinct toward garden, and reduced curiosity about rituals. Takes 6-12 weeks to fully establish. Reversible with isolation.</div></div>',
      '<div class="term-entry"><div class="term-title">Rest Node</div><div class="term-def">Seeded grow site where vampire can safely sleep without degradation. Network of rest nodes enables continental-scale mobility. One vampire typically maintains 5-15 active nodes.</div></div>',
      '<div class="term-entry"><div class="term-title">Signature Fidelity</div><div class="term-def">Measure of how accurately the cloned signature matches the original homeland. 85-94% fidelity is sufficient for full vampire function. Below 80% triggers degradation. Brokers test and optimize fidelity.</div></div>',
      '<div class="term-entry"><div class="term-title">Signature Refresh</div><div class="term-div">Major reapplication of blood/bone/homeland tea, typically at harvest or every 8-12 weeks.

Vampire experiences disorientation, sensory dulling, glamour timing collapse, and increased feeding urgency. Visible tell that signature has broken or was never properly established.</div></div>',
      '<div class="term-entry"><div class="term-title">Sleep-Salt</div><div class="term-def">Toxic buildup that occurs when wake pads are not refreshed properly. Causes torpor paralysis followed by violent rebound. Hunters can trigger this by introducing actual salt or iron filings to pads.</div></div>',
      '<div class="term-entry"><div class="term-title">Sachet Swap</div><div class="term-def">Hunter interdiction tactic: intercept homeland pinch shipment, replace with sterile soil, reseal. Signature fails at destination. Vampire degrades without knowing why. Non-destructive but highly effective.</div></div>',
      '<div class="term-entry"><div class="term-title">Boiling Mandate</div><div class="term-def">Regulatory requirement (pushed by hunters) to boil all organic tea preparations for safety. Kills volatile carriers in blood/bone tea. Signature won\'t transfer. Vampires forced to relocate or suffer degradation.</div></div>',
      '<div class="term-entry"><div class="term-title">Pad Salting</div><div class="term-def">Introducing iron filings or sea salt to wake pads during inspection. Creates micro-shocks in vampire metabolism during sleep. Breaks timing, triggers homesick drift. Subtle sabotage method.</div></div>',

    scale_assumptions: [
      '<strong>We thought: Blood & Soil is rare, experimental.</strong><br>Reality: It\'s widespread and decades old. Conservative estimate: 200-500 active operations in North America alone. Likely more in legal cannabis states where cover is best.',
      '<strong>We thought: Only old vampires use this system.</strong><br>Reality: Vampires of all ages adopt it once they learn about it. Young vampires love the mobility. Old vampires love the relief from homeland imprisonment. Age doesn\'t predict adoption.',
      '<strong>We thought: It only works in large commercial grows.</strong><br>Reality: Home grows (6-12 plants) work fine for individual vampire use. Commercial scale is preferred for network operations, but system scales down to closet grows.',
      '<strong>We thought: Vampires would never trust human handlers.</strong><br>Reality: Thrall drift provides sufficient loyalty. Vampires don\'t need to trust—they need to dose. Chemistry replaces trust. Handlers genuinely believe they\'re doing normal work.',
      '<strong>We thought: This was primarily a West Coast phenomenon.</strong><br>Reality: Operates anywhere cannabis grows legally or illegally. Found operations in Colorado, Oregon, California, Michigan, Maine, Oklahoma, and Canada. Not geographically limited.'
    ],
    biological_assumptions: [
      '<strong>We thought: Vampires need fresh blood daily.</strong><br>Reality: With Blood & Soil, micro-feeding reduces hunting frequency by 70-80%. Some disciplined vampires go months between actual feeding events. System enables harm reduction for vampires who want it.',
      '<strong>We thought: Homeland soil loses potency over time.</strong><br>Reality: Properly stored (vacuum-sealed, cool, dry), homeland pinch remains viable for 5-10 years. Microbial spores are remarkably resilient. Storage matters more than age.',
      '<strong>We thought: Wrong signature would be immediately obvious to vampire.</strong><br>Reality: Signature degradation is gradual. Vampire may not notice for days or weeks. By the time symptoms appear (homesick drift), they\'re already compromised. This is why sachet swaps work.',
      '<strong>We thought: Thrall drift was permanent.</strong><br>Reality: It\'s reversible with isolation. 4-8 weeks without exposure and most effects fade. Some handlers report lingering fondness for "that job," but they\'re not permanently compromised.',
      '<strong>We thought: Cannabinoid effects were just vampire preference.</strong><br>Reality: Cannabinoids serve functional purposes—daylight stability, frenzy control, appetite regulation. It\'s not recreational. It\'s operational chemistry that makes the system viable.'
    ],
    tactical_assumptions: [
      '<strong>We thought: Burning the garden kills the operation.</strong><br>Reality: It just forces relocation. Vampire has backup sites or establishes new ones within weeks. Burning wastes evidence, harms handlers, and accomplishes nothing strategic.',
      '<strong>We thought: Arresting handlers would disrupt the network.</strong><br>Reality: Handlers are replaceable. Vampire recruits new ones within 1-2 months. Broker retrains them. Network resilience is high. Better to flip handlers or target brokers.',
      '<strong>We thought: Vampires would fight for their grows.</strong><br>Reality: Vampires almost always relocate rather than fight. Risking exposure over one site isn\'t worth it when they can seed ten more. They\'re strategic, not territorial about specific locations.',
      '<strong>We thought: Police raids on cannabis grows would catch vampires.</strong><br>Reality: Vampires aren\'t at the grows when police raid. Police arrest human handlers (if illegal jurisdiction), seize plants, and vampire just moves. Police raids are ineffective without hunter coordination.',
      '<strong>We thought: Blood & Soil was financially motivated.</strong><br>Reality: For vampires, it\'s about survival and mobility—not profit. Cannabis sales offset costs, but operations break even at best. The value is strategic: safety, range extension, stealth feeding.'
    ],
    detection_assumptions: [
      '<strong>We thought: Blood & Soil grows would smell different than normal grows.</strong><br>Reality: Terpene smell is similar. Metallic iron note is subtle and easily missed unless you\'re specifically trained to detect it. Scent alone isn\'t reliable without other tells.',
      '<strong>We thought: Handlers would seem "off" or zombie-like.</strong><br>Reality: Thrall-drifted handlers seem calm, professional, and genuinely enthusiastic about their work. They\'re not glassy-eyed zombies. They\'re model employees. This makes them harder to identify.',
      '<strong>We thought: Vampires would use obviously occult symbolism.</strong><br>Reality: Operations look boringly normal. No pentagrams, candles, altars. Just clean, professional grow rooms with slightly weird timing protocols. Occult aesthetics would draw attention.',
      '<strong>We thought: Brokers would be obviously suspicious characters.</strong><br>Reality: Brokers have legitimate credentials, professional demeanor, and often genuinely believe they\'re doing advanced organic consulting. Many don\'t fully understand the vampire component.',
      '<strong>We thought: We could detect signature presence with instruments.</strong><br>Reality: No device reliably detects homeland signature. It\'s a complex of microbes and minerals that requires lab analysis. Field detection relies on behavioral tells, not sensors.'
