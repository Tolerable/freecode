## ADDITIONAL PRODUCTION NOTES

### Image Timing Guidelines

**Hold Duration Standards**:
- Establishing shots: 10-15 seconds
- Transition images: 5-8 seconds
- Emphasis moments: 6-8 seconds
- Quick beats: 3-5 seconds
- Final shots: 8-10 seconds with fade

### Animation Suggestions

Most images should be STATIC, but subtle motion can enhance:
- Slow zoom in/out (Ken Burns effect)
- Slight parallax on layered elements
- Gentle camera shake on intense moments
- Flicker effects on fluorescent lighting
- Dust particles drifting in light beams
- Document pages slight flutter
- Screen glitch/static on digital displays

### Color Grading Notes

**Overall Palette**:
- Shadows: Deep blue-black, never pure black
- Highlights: Slightly warm but not golden, institutional lighting
- Midtones: Desaturated, documentary realism
- Accent colors: Match vault system (red, blue, orange, violet, gold)

**Avoid**:
- Over-saturated horror movie reds
- Music video color grading
- Instagram filter aesthetics
- Anything that looks "designed" rather than "documented"

### Accessibility Considerations

- High contrast for visibility
- Text should be legible at 1080p
- No flashing/strobing effects (epilepsy safety)
- Images support audio, never contradict it
- Provide image descriptions in metadata
