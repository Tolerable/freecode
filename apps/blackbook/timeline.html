NOTE:
This script expects the following CSS variables / layout already defined in <head> for timeline.html:

We assume in <head> you set:
  --accent: #6bff8a; (radiation-sick green / contamination vibe)
  --accent-soft: rgba(107,255,138,0.18);
  and the same base structure as other pages (fonts, nav, cards, etc.)
  plus the timeline-specific classes below:

- Sidebar list class is 'era-list'
- era-item structure mirrors others (role-item / threat-item pattern),
  but fields are era name + tag + summary line.

Behavior:
Left column lists eras.
Clicking one loads details:
  keyMoments[] = big milestone events in that era
  coverStory[] = what excuses were invented / popularized then
  escalation[] = how monsters evolved tactics
  whatChanged[] = what humans started doing that helped (or made it worse)
  notes[] = extra
We open first two accordions by default like other pages.
We also limit max 2 open section-cards at once, like other pages.
