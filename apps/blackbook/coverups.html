      'Injuries are described as "consistent with animal predation" even if bones are crushed in a way that suggests upright, two-handed leverage.',

    investigate: [
      'Ask: did anyone actually see an animal, or did they just see “shadows”? Most times, nobody saw anything with fur.',
      'Look for entry/exit that an actual animal could not work (latch opened, deadbolt undone, sliding glass door lifted).',
