    profile: 'Vampires are long-game predators. They do not just drink you. They manage you, your story, your memory, and the story other people will tell about what happened. They do not hunt bodies. They hunt belief.',
    lies: [
      'We cannot be seen in mirrors. That rumor creates a fake safety test. If you see a reflection, you relax. Relaxed prey is easy prey.',
      'Sunlight instantly turns us to ash. Truth: some burn fast, most just weaken, blister, and rage. The myth makes you think sunrise equals safety and you let your guard down at 5 AM.',
      'We cannot enter unless invited. This is social engineering. The ritual of "invite the nice stranger in" becomes part of your guilt when people ask how we got access.',
      'We are tragic, romantic, lonely, secretly kind. This makes people want to be chosen instead of running.'
    ],
    reality: [
      'They are political animals. Old vampires buy law enforcement, media, and hospitals so that "official cause of death" never says exsanguination.',
      'They do show up on cameras and in mirrors. They helped push the myth because once you think "reflection means normal human," they walk anywhere.',
      'They run blood as a controlled substance. It is currency, leverage, addiction bait, and blackmail.',
      'They maintain handlers: human assistants who think they are special. Those humans do most of the messy stuff.'
    ],
    tactics: [
      'Charm and credibility: they talk like someone you should already trust, like a doctor, lawyer, priest, celebrity, or person above your pay grade.',
      'Memory fog: they feed you redirection stories right after the trauma so your first retelling sounds unsure. First retelling becomes your official memory.',
      'Divide and isolate: they try to get you alone physically, but also socially alone. If nobody will believe you after, it is already a clean kill.',
      'Narrative laundering: they seed rumors and urban legends that benefit them (mirror myth, "invite only," sexy immortal lover story, etc.).'
    ],
    survive: [
      'Do not debate with it. You will lose. Break line-of-sight, create loud chaos, get witnesses, get light.',
      'Record them and distribute fast. Public exposure wrecks their cover more than any stake.',
      'Fire and removal of head still works because biology is biology, no matter how elegant they act.',
      'Treat glamour like a drug effect. If you suddenly feel calm, adored, or stupid-happy in danger, assume manipulation and move.'
    ],
    lore: [
      'Older bloodlines can starve for months without looking weak. Hunger just makes them meaner, not slower.',
      'They hate unpredictability. Drunks, unmedicated bipolars, and people who don\'t act "normal" are often left alone because they are harder to script.',

      'Only a silver bullet to the heart can kill me. That lie tells you to not even try anything else, and also makes you waste time crafting rare ammo.',
      'I only transform on the full moon. That gives them 27 safe hunting nights where you think you are fine.',
      'I black out and don\'t remember anything. That removes motive so you never connect "the beast" to "your jealous coworker."',
